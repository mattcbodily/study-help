# Getting Job Ready

Interviewing for a development role can be really tricky. Getting your resume noticed can be even trickier, because the Junior Developer role is very over-saturated. This readme will help you have a guide on what to learn for interviews, as well as what you can do to help your resume get noticed. This will focus specifically on Frontend Developer roles.

## The structure of most interviews

When you do get an interview for a developer role, you will often follow these steps:

1. A phone interview with a recruiter / talent department representative to get a feel for your knowledge and experience. This step is relatively straightforward, and just a way for the company to make sure the information on your resume is accurate.
2. A verbal technical interview with a hiring manager / senior developer, asking questions about coding concepts to gauge the depth of your knowledge. This portion of the interview process can be difficult, but keep in mind that you don't need to be perfect. The individual running the interview is likely going to ask you questions until you can't answer a few just make sure they know exactly what your coding knowledge is. The biggest mistake an interviewee can make here is not admitting when they don't know the answer. Ask plenty of clarifying questions if you don't understand what is being asked, but be willing to admit when you don't know the answer to a question, and then show a willingness to learn.
3. A live coding interview / take home code project. After the verbal technical interview, you will likely have an interview with a different developer / hiring manager, or a take home coding project. If it's a live coding interview, you will likely be given a couple toy problems that you will need to solve either on a whiteboard or some virtual equivalent. These toy problems allow the interviewers to see your problem solving ability live. The code syntax in this interview does not need to be perfect, as the most important part of this interview is to show how you go about thinking and solving a coding problem. Show and verbalize your thought process through every step of the problem. If you get a take home code project, read the requirements carefully, and then fulfill the required portions first. Many of these code projects will have bonus features that you can work on if you have time. Don't expect a fully finished project, but do strive to finish all the main requirements.

## Topics to know

This section will cover what topics you will need to know. You should be able to verbalize what these concepts are to an employer during the technical interview, as well as be able to demonstrate these concepts through code in portfolio projects (if applicable).
