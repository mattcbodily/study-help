# Getting Job Ready

Interviewing for a development role can be really tricky. Getting your resume noticed can be even trickier, because the Junior Developer role is very over-saturated. This readme will help you have a guide on what to learn for interviews, as well as what you can do to help your resume get noticed. This will focus specifically on Frontend Developer roles.

## Building a portfolio & resume

The junior developer market is very over saturated at the moment, meaning there are more people looking for these roles than there are roles available. This creates really stiff competition to even get interviews for these jobs. You have to create a portfolio and resume that stand out from others. While many have good intentions with setting themselves apart in their portfolio, they often do things that won't actually help them in the long run. Some things you should avoid when building a portfolio:

1. Building projects from YouTube videos EXACTLY the way the YouTuber does it (including styling and functionality). Copying someone elses project exactly does not show any individual coding ability. If you are asked about technical details of one of these projects, you are more likely to be unable to answer since you did not build it yourself.
2. Learning tons of new frameworks / libraries / technologies. As a junior developer you will not need to know every framework, library, and technology (this isn't even expected of senior developers). Stick with one and get really good at it.
3. Giving up on projects because they are hard. Building projects is one of the best ways to learn, and you should often choose projects that take you out of your comfort zone. If you're only building projects that you are comfortable with building, you probably aren't learning anything new.

Things you should do when building a portfolio:

1. Build projects from scratch, and document the process of building the project. In interviews you will likely be asked about projects on your portfolio. Building something from scratch and documenting the process can help you out tremendously with the questions you are asked, as well as offer you the experience of building something new.
2. Build a project that will actually be used on the internet. Whether this is for yourself, a small business, or something else, having the experience of taking a project live will provide valuable experience you can talk about in interviews.
3. Find people to teach code to. Teaching is the absolute best way to learn a topic more deeply. Teaching forces you to really understand the topic, and forces you to be able to verbalize it in a way that others understand. This is great practice for interviews, and even better for your understanding of code. You can even find volunteer opportunities to teach code, which will also help you stand out on your resume with the benefit of also helping others learning to code.
4. Build a portfolio website to showcase your work, and share it on applicable social media (LinkedIn is a great option). Your portfolio website does NOT have to be the most incredible thing in the world, but it should be a clean design that shows off your projects, as well as provides contact information to recruiters that come across the site.

Your resume should focus on your experience (if applicable) as well as your education and hard / soft skills. Make sure to mention what languages and framework / library you specialize in. If you don't have applicable work experience, add your portfolio projects instead, and highlight what they are built with, and what they do. When adding soft skills to your resume, focus on problem solving and communication skills). Keep in mind that you will likely want to change your resume slightly with each application, to change the role to match the role in the job description (if applicable), and to greater highlight the skills you have that the company is looking for.

## The structure of most interviews

When you do get an interview for a developer role, you will often follow these steps:

1. A phone interview with a recruiter / talent department representative to get a feel for your knowledge and experience. This step is relatively straightforward, and just a way for the company to make sure the information on your resume is accurate.
2. A verbal technical interview with a hiring manager / senior developer, asking questions about coding concepts to gauge the depth of your knowledge. This portion of the interview process can be difficult, but keep in mind that you don't need to be perfect. The individual running the interview is likely going to ask you questions until you can't answer a few just make sure they know exactly what your coding knowledge is. The biggest mistake an interviewee can make here is not admitting when they don't know the answer. Ask plenty of clarifying questions if you don't understand what is being asked, but be willing to admit when you don't know the answer to a question, and then show a willingness to learn.
3. A live coding interview / take home code project. After the verbal technical interview, you will likely have an interview with a different developer / hiring manager, or a take home coding project. If it's a live coding interview, you will likely be given a couple toy problems that you will need to solve either on a whiteboard or some virtual equivalent. These toy problems allow the interviewers to see your problem solving ability live. The code syntax in this interview does not need to be perfect, as the most important part of this interview is to show how you go about thinking and solving a coding problem. Show and verbalize your thought process through every step of the problem. If you get a take home code project, read the requirements carefully, and then fulfill the required portions first. Many of these code projects will have bonus features that you can work on if you have time. Don't expect a fully finished project, but do strive to finish all the main requirements.

## Topics to know

This section will cover what topics you will need to know. You should be able to verbalize what these concepts are to an employer during the technical interview, as well as be able to demonstrate these concepts through code in portfolio projects (if applicable). 

### HTML

Most interviews will not focus heavily on HTML, but it is important to know a few topics, such as:

1. Accessibility (A11y) concepts, such as how to use `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-role` and others. These are essential and used often.
2. Semantic HTML. Not every company uses this, but even if they don't, it's good to be familiar with semantic tags (`section, main, aside, etc`), and how they differ from `div`.
3. The basic boilerplate of an HTML file. Know the basic tags to get started (`html, head, body`), and what those tags do. Also be familiar with how to use the `link` tag. While this might not come up in every interview, it's good to know.
4. Events. While this may be posed as a JavaScript question, you may also see it here. Be able to define what an event is, and how they can be handled (event handlers and event listeners). Make the connection between events and JavaScript functions.

### CSS

Like HTML, CSS will not be heavily focused on in interviews, but it is important to know a few topics, such as:

1. Responsive design through media queries or other means. It's important to know how to code CSS that works on different screen sizes.
2. Flexbox / Grid. Flexbox is a common CSS topic that comes up, as it shows basic layout skills. Know about flexbox and its different properties.
3. Accessibility (A11y). CSS also plays a role in accessibility, particularly through element size and color contrast.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is the most heavily focused on topic in frontend developer interviews. Here are a few important topics to be familiar with:

1. Variables / Data Types. Know how to declare and define a variable. Know the difference between `var, let,` and `const`. Know the basic data types in JS. Be able to define what a variable is.
2. Functions. Know how to write a function (as a declaration, expression, or arrow). Know what parameters and arguments are. Know the importance of the `return` keyword, and what it does. Be able to define what a function is.
3. If / else, switch / case, ternary. These may not come up often, but it's important to know the different ways you can handle conditional code in JavaScript. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding these topics.
4. Working with arrays. Be familiar with how to work with arrays, such as accessing and changing values, looping through arrays, using common higher order array methods (`map, filter, reduce`).
5. Working with objects. Be familiar with how to work with objects, such as accessing and changing values, looping through objects, creating shallow copies of objects, etc.
6. Higher order functions / callback functions. Be familiar with the ability of a JavaScript function to take another function as an argument, and why this might be useful (to reuse logic).
7. Accessing html elements. Be familiar with the document object, and how you can use it to target DOM nodes, listen for events, and more.
8. Constructor functions / classes. Be familiar with the concept of constructor functions and classes, and when you might use them. Be familiar with prototype functions and prototypical inheritance.

These are some common topics, but you should always be looking to learn more JavaScript, and prepare to explain verbally any concept, as well as be able to demonstrate how to use any of the above through written code.

### React

If you're interviewing for a React position, here are some useful topics to know:

1. Component based architecture. Be able to explain what a React component is. Be familiar with class and functional components, how state is held in both, and be able to explain the differences between the two types of components. Be able to explain the component lifecycle, and how we can take advantage of it though lifecycle methods and hooks.
2. State / props. Be familiar with how state is held in a component, and how props are passed.
3. JSX. Be able to explain the differences between JSX and HTML.

## Final thoughts

Don't be afraid to go for internships! While some may shy away from internships because they often pay less and don't guarantee full time employment after, they are a great way to get your foot in the door of a company. Often you just need a chance to show what you can do, and many times if the company is impressed with an interns work, they will bring on that intern as a full time employee (with full time pay) if they can. Even if they can't, you will have the experience that you can put on your resume, which will help set you apart from those that don't have work experience, making it easier to get interviews in the future.

You'll find yourself applying to a lot of jobs, and will likely only hear back from a handful of companies. The majority of the emails you will get back will likely be rejection emails (this is super common when going for junior positions), but don't be discouraged by those. If you get the chance, ask the individual who sent the rejection email what you could do the next time around to get an interview. This will often lead to advice regarding your portfolio or resume that you can then act on to make it easier to get an interview in the future.

Network a lot! Networking is one of the most important and valuable things you can do when looking for your first dev job. Be active on LinkedIn, find recruiters to companies you are interested in, talk with them about their company and what they look for in developers, and talk to developers in the field about what their day to day is like. You will find that many developers are happy to talk to you and help you out where they can.

Last thing is don't be discouraged. Getting your first dev job can take a while and can be difficult, but if you keep working at it and improving your skills you will likely get an opportunity.
