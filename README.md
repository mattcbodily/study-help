# Getting Job Ready

Interviewing for a development role can be really tricky. Getting your resume noticed can be even trickier, because the Junior Developer role is very over-saturated. This readme will help you have a guide on what to learn for interviews, as well as what you can do to help your resume get noticed. This will focus specifically on Frontend Developer roles.

## The structure of most interviews

When you do get an interview for a developer role, you will often follow these steps:

1. A phone interview with a recruiter / talent department representative to get a feel for your knowledge and experience. This step is relatively straightforward, and just a way for the company to make sure the information on your resume is accurate.
2. A verbal technical interview with a hiring manager / senior developer, asking questions about coding concepts to gauge the depth of your knowledge. This portion of the interview process can be difficult, but keep in mind that you don't need to be perfect. The individual running the interview is likely going to ask you questions until you can't answer a few just make sure they know exactly what your coding knowledge is. The biggest mistake an interviewee can make here is not admitting when they don't know the answer. Ask plenty of clarifying questions if you don't understand what is being asked, but be willing to admit when you don't know the answer to a question, and then show a willingness to learn.
3. A live coding interview / take home code project. After the verbal technical interview, you will likely have an interview with a different developer / hiring manager, or a take home coding project. If it's a live coding interview, you will likely be given a couple toy problems that you will need to solve either on a whiteboard or some virtual equivalent. These toy problems allow the interviewers to see your problem solving ability live. The code syntax in this interview does not need to be perfect, as the most important part of this interview is to show how you go about thinking and solving a coding problem. Show and verbalize your thought process through every step of the problem. If you get a take home code project, read the requirements carefully, and then fulfill the required portions first. Many of these code projects will have bonus features that you can work on if you have time. Don't expect a fully finished project, but do strive to finish all the main requirements.

## Topics to know

This section will cover what topics you will need to know. You should be able to verbalize what these concepts are to an employer during the technical interview, as well as be able to demonstrate these concepts through code in portfolio projects (if applicable). 

### HTML

Most interviews will not focus heavily on HTML, but it is important to know a few topics, such as:

1. Accessibility (A11y) concepts, such as how to use `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-role` and others. These are essential and used often.
2. Semantic HTML. Not every company uses this, but even if they don't, it's good to be familiar with semantic tags (`section, main, aside, etc`), and how they differ from `div`.
3. The basic boilerplate of an HTML file. Know the basic tags to get started (`html, head, body`), and what those tags do. Also be familiar with how to use the `link` tag. While this might not come up in every interview, it's good to know.
4. Events. While this may be posed as a JavaScript question, you may also see it here. Be able to define what an event is, and how they can be handled (event handlers and event listeners). Make the connection between events and JavaScript functions.

### CSS

Like HTML, CSS will not be heavily focused on in interviews, but it is important to know a few topics, such as:

1. Responsive design through media queries or other means. It's important to know how to code CSS that works on different screen sizes.
2. Flexbox / Grid. Flexbox is a common CSS topic that comes up, as it shows basic layout skills. Know about flexbox and its different properties.
3. Accessibility (A11y). CSS also plays a role in accessibility, particularly through element size and color contrast.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is the most heavily focused on topic in frontend developer interviews. Here are a few important topics to be familiar with:

1. Variables / Data Types. Know how to declare and define a variable. Know the difference between `var, let,` and `const`. Know the basic data types in JS. Be able to define what a variable is.
2. Functions. Know how to write a function (as a declaration, expression, or arrow). Know what parameters and arguments are. Know the importance of the `return` keyword, and what it does. Be able to define what a function is.
3. If / else, switch / case, ternary. These may not come up often, but it's important to know the different ways you can handle conditional code in JavaScript. Be prepared to answer any questions regarding these topics.
4. Working with arrays. Be familiar with how to work with arrays, such as accessing and changing values, looping through arrays, using common higher order array methods (`map, filter, reduce`).
5. Working with objects. Be familiar with how to work with objects, such as accessing and changing values, looping through objects, creating shallow copies of objects, etc.
6. Higher order functions / callback functions. Be familiar with the ability of a JavaScript function to take another function as an argument, and why this might be useful (to reuse logic).
7. Accessing html elements. Be familiar with the document object, and how you can use it to target DOM nodes, listen for events, and more.
8. Constructor functions / classes. Be familiar with the concept of constructor functions and classes, and when you might use them. Be familiar with prototype functions and prototypical inheritance.

These are some common topics, but you should always be looking to learn more JavaScript, and prepare to explain verbally any concept, as well as be able to demonstrate how to use any of the above through written code.

### React

If you're interviewing for a React position, here are some useful topics to know:

1. Component based architecture. Be able to explain what a React component is. Be familiar with class and functional components, how state is held in both, and be able to explain the differences between the two types of components. Be able to explain the component lifecycle, and how we can take advantage of it though lifecycle methods and hooks.
2. State / props. Be familiar with how state is held in a component, and how props are passed.
3. JSX. Be able to explain the differences between JSX and HTML.
